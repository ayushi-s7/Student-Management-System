# Student-Management-System
The student management system is a project where all the process of the student in the institution is managed. It is done through the automated computerized method. Conventionally this system is done using papers, files, and binders. This system saves the time of the student and of the faculty. It includes processes like registration of the studentâ€™s details, assigning them course, storing their marks, attendance and maintenance of the record. This system reduces the cost and workforce required for this job. As the system is online the information is globally present to everyone.
This makes the system easy to handle and feasible for updating at the same time. As for the existing system, they use to maintain their record manually which makes it vulnerable to security. If filed a query to search or update in a manual system, it will take a lot of time to process the query and make a report which is a tedious job.
